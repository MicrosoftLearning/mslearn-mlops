# Challenge: Create an Azure Machine Learning job

## Challenge scenario

The first step to automate machine learning workflows is to create a workflow of the machine learning workloads. To execute any workflow consisting of Python scripts, use Azure Machine Learning jobs.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't, complete the [set-up](00-set-up.md) before you continue.

## Objectives

By completing this challenge, you'll learn how to:

- Define an Azure Machine Learning job in YAML.
- Run an Azure Machine Learning job with the CLI v2.

## Challenge Duration

- **Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

## Instructions

In the **src/model** folder, you'll find a Python script which reads CSV files from a datastore and uses the data to train a classification model. In the **src** folder, you'll find a YAML file to define a job. There are values missing in the YAML file. It's up to you to complete it. 

- Run the script as a **job** in Azure Machine Learning. Complete the YAML file to define the job.
- Use the registered **data** asset in the Azure Machine Learning workspace as input to the job.
- Run the job using an Azure Machine Learning **compute instance** (don't forget to stop it when done, there's a workflow to help you).
- Trigger the job using the CLI v2 using the Cloud Shell or a local terminal.

> **Tip:**
> Whether you're working from the Cloud Shell or a local terminal, make sure to update the Azure Machine Learning extension for the CLI to the latest version.

## Success criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to show:

- A successfully completed job in the Azure Machine Learning workspace.

> **Note:**
> If you've used a compute instance for experimentation, remember to stop the compute instance when you're done. You can use the **Stop compute instance** workflow to stop the compute instance in your Azure Machine Learning workspace with GitHub Actions.
